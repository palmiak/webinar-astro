# Kinsta - Hello World - Static Site With Astro ðŸš€

An example of how to deploy a static site built with Astro on Kinsta App Hosting services.

> Kinstaâ€™s Application Hosting is a service to run your web apps and any databases side by side in a hassle-free environment, tailored for developer needs and ease of use. App Hosting is currently in an invite-only beta phase, sign up for a test account at [kinsta.com/application-hosting](https://kinsta.com/application-hosting/).

## Dependency Management

During the deployment process Kinsta will automatically install dependencies defined in your `package.json` file.

## Web Server Setup

### Port

Kinsta automatically sets the `PORT` environment variable. You should **not** define it yourself and you should **not** hard-code it into the application. The `serve` packageutilizes the port set by Kinsta automatically.

### Start Command

When deploying an application Kinsta will automatically create a web process with `npm start` as the entry point. Make sure to use this command to run your server.

## Deployment Lifecycle

Whenever a deployment is initiated (through creating an application or re-deploying due to an incoming commit) the `npm build` command is run, followed by the `npm start` command.
